## Overview

### The challenge

- I had to build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/

## My process
### Why did you choose this person?
- I have always admired Rihanna for her unwavering determination in acheiving her dreams, blunt personality, constantly expressing pride in being from Barbados, and not being afraid to be experimental with music and beauty.   
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox properties 
### What did you learn from this project?
At first, I used regular CSS, per FreeCodeCamp's directions to user stories like center the figure. However, I wanted to experiment with Flexbox more, so I went with that approach. Through this experience I learned that there's no "one-size-fits-all" method to coding. 

### Code Snippets:

 HTML

Creating a website section
```
<section class="website area">
      <h1 id="section-title"> Discography</h1> 
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="container"> 
          <h4 class="album-title"> Album 1</h4> 
          <a href="#"  target="_blank"> <img class="album-cover" src="#">
        </div>
        
```

CSS

Styling links
```
/* unvisited link */
  a:link {
	color: red;
  }
 ``` 

### Continued development
- More CSS Flexbox
- Implementing ARIA-Role tags 
- JavaScript 


### Useful resources
<!-- Pick 2-3 sources that stood out to you. -->
- [W3 Schools: How to create a Contact Form](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp) - This source gave a me few ideas on how to create the form and structure its textbox. I highly recommend it if you are struggling with using the div element to create a form's structure. 
- [FreeCodeCamp: CSS Button Style – Hover, Color, and Background](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-button-style-hover-color-and-background/) - I found this article when I was struggling to style my button. It gave me some ideas on how to make my button appealing. If you're still learning this concept or need a refresher, I highly recommend reading this article.
